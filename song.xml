            Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
            That saved a wretch like me;
            I once was lost, but now am found;
            Was blind, but now I see.

            ’Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
            And grace my fears relieved;
            How precious did that grace appear
            The hour I first believed.

            Praise God, Praise God.
